This is the frontendmentor challenge of creating a blog preview card.

I used semantic html and css flexbox techniques

Earlier I was using div tag a lot and not giving preference to the semantic tags in html.

Also this time I avoided over use of px unit, instead I used rem unit in css selectors.

This code for html and css is not fully mine, I have used the coding of @Outstandinggirl13 who is also a frontend coder.

The problem I faced in creating this was aligning everything and making a container of that exact size as mentioned in the challenge.
